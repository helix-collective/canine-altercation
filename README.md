# Kanine Altercation

An arena style mmo dogfight. Started life as a side project on Helix's Perisher offsite between @prunge and @jeeva

## Game mechanics

 - One shot kills
 - Ships have a noticeable reload delay, and there is no UI feedback as to when you can fire
 - If ships collide, hit arena edges or space-junk/asteroids, they slide of each other

## Client/Server
 - Needs client side prediction, reconciliation and interpolation to be smooth
